Operating Systems – Course Repository
Welcome to my personal repository for the Operating Systems course (Course Code: CS302) at Tbilisi State University. Throughout the semester, I’ll be uploading lecture notes, lab work, code examples, and anything else useful for understanding how operating systems work under the hood.

🧠 Course Overview
Operating systems are the backbone of any computer system — they manage everything from executing programs and handling memory to managing security. In this course, we explore how operating systems function internally and interact with hardware and software.

Topics Covered
What is an OS? – Introduction, history, and significance

Processes & Threads – Executing programs and concurrency

CPU Scheduling – Deciding which process runs next

Memory Management – RAM, virtual memory, paging, segmentation

File Systems – Behind-the-scenes file and directory management

Inter-Process Communication – How processes exchange data

Synchronization – Semaphores, mutexes, race conditions

Deadlocks – Detection, avoidance, and prevention

I/O Systems – Managing hardware like disks, keyboards, etc.

Security & Protection – Safeguarding resources and access control

Distributed & Multi-core Systems – Parallelism and system communication
