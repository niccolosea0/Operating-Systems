# Operating Systems â€“ Course Repository

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal repository for the **Operating Systems** course (CS302) at Tbilisi State University. Throughout the semester, Iâ€™ll be uploading lecture notes, labs, code examples, and anything else I find useful while learning how operating systems work under the hood.

## ðŸ§  What This Course Is About

Operating systems are the core of any computer system â€” they manage everything from running programs to handling memory and keeping things secure. In this course, we explore how all of that actually works.

## ðŸ—‚ Topics We Cover

Here's a quick overview of the key topics:

* **What is an OS?** â€“ Intro, history, and why they matter  
* **Processes & Threads** â€“ Running programs and doing things in parallel  
* **CPU Scheduling** â€“ How the OS decides what to run next  
* **Memory Management** â€“ RAM, virtual memory, paging, and segmentation  
* **File Systems** â€“ How files and folders are organized behind the scenes  
* **Inter-Process Communication** â€“ How programs talk to each other  
* **Synchronization** â€“ Semaphores, mutexes, and keeping things in sync  
* **Deadlocks** â€“ When processes get stuck and how to avoid it  
* **I/O Systems** â€“ How the OS handles keyboards, disks, etc.  
* **Security & Protection** â€“ Keeping the system and data safe  
* **Distributed & Multi-core Systems** â€“ Going beyond one machine or core  

## ðŸ§ª What Youâ€™ll Find Here

* `notes/` â€“ Summary notes from lectures and readings  
* `labs/` â€“ Practical C code exploring OS concepts like process creation, memory, and file handling  
* `assignments/` â€“ Any coursework or mini-projects  
* `extras/` â€“ Cool things I find along the way (cheatsheets, examples, etc.)
